/* ------------------------------- Problem 01 ------------------------------- */

//? Answer: 
//* An execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed

//? How its work
/*
Creation Phase:
    1. function parameter value set
    2. hoisting all
    3. variable initialized (in temporal dead zone)
    4. set undefined ver variable and initialize
    5. create scope chain

//TODO: What is the function of global context? Why is it needed?
/* ------------------------------- Problem 02 ------------------------------- */

//? Answer: 
//* The Global Context is the default environment where any JavaScript 
//* code runs when it's not inside a function.
//* It is the first execution context created when a JavaScript program starts,
//* and it stays in memory until the program finishes or the page is closed.

//? Why need Global Context: 
/*
1. Creating the Global Object
    In browsers: window
    In Node.js: global
2. Storing Global Variables and Functions
3. Setting the Default this Value
*  The Global Execution Context  is like the foundation of a building:
    It must exist before any rooms (functions) can be created.
    Without the foundation (global context), you canâ€™t build or organize anything.
